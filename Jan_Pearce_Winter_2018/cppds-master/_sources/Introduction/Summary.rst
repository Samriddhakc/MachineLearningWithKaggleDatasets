Summary
-------

-  Computer science is the study of problem solving.

-  Computer science uses abstraction as a tool for representing both
   processes and data.

-  Abstract data types allow programmers to manage the complexity of a
   problem domain by hiding the details of the data.

-  C++ is a powerful object-oriented language.

-  Arrays, tuples, and strings are C++ sequential
   collections from standard template libraries.

-  Hash tables and sets are nonsequential collections of data.

-  Classes allow programmers to implement abstract data types.

-  Programmers can override standard methods as well as create new
   methods.

-  Classes can be organized into hierarchies.

-  A class constructor should always invoke the constructor of its
   parent before continuing on with its own data and behavior.
