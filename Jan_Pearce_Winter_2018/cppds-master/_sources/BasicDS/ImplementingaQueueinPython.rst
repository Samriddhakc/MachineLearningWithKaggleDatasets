Using a Queue in C++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have clearly defined the queue as an abstract data type, similarly to the how we've previously used the Stack, we
will turn our attention to using a queue with the help of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. Recall
that when we give an abstract data type a physical implementation we
refer to the implementation as a data structure.

As we described in Chapter 1, in C++, as in any object-oriented
programming language, the implementation of choice for an abstract data
type such as a queue is the creation of a new class. The queue
operations are implemented as methods. However, the STL already has a well
written implementation of the Queue class.

The following queue implementation (:ref:`ActiveCode 1 <lst_queuecode1>`) assumes that
the end of the list will hold the rear element of the queue. As the queue
grows (as ``push`` operations occur), new items will be added on the end
of the list. ``pop`` operations will manipulate the opposite side, the front end.

        	newQueue.push(3);
        	newQueue.push(8);
        	newQueue.push(15);

        	cout << "Queue Empty? " << newQueue.empty() << endl;

        	cout << "Queue Size: " << newQueue.size() << endl;

        	cout << "Top Element of the Queue: " << newQueue.front() << endl;

        	newQueue.pop();

        	cout << "Top Element of the Queue: " << newQueue.front() << endl;

        	return 0;

               self.items = []

           def isEmpty(self):

     :feedback_a: Remember the first thing added to the queue is the first thing removed.  FIFO
     :feedback_b: Yes, first in first out means that 10 is gone
     :feedback_c: Queues, and Stacks are both data structures where you can only access the first and the last thing.
     :feedback_d: Ooops, maybe you missed the pop call at the end?

     Suppose you have the following series of queue operations.

     ::

         queue<int> intQueue;
         q.push(10);
         q.push(20);
         q.push(30);
         q.pop();
         q = Queue()
         q.push('hello')
         q.push('dog')
         q.push(3)
         q.pop()

     What items are left on the queue?
