Using a Stack in C++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have clearly defined the stack as an abstract data type we
will turn our attention to using a stack with the help of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. Recall
that when we give an abstract data type a physical implementation we
refer to the implementation as a data structure.

As we described in Chapter 1, in C++, as in any object-oriented
programming language, the implementation of choice for an abstract data
type such as a stack is the creation of a new class. The stack
operations are implemented as methods. However, the STL already has a well
written implementation of the Stack class.

The following stack implementation (:ref:`ActiveCode 1 <lst_stackcode1>`) assumes that
the end of the list will hold the top element of the stack. As the stack
grows (as ``push`` operations occur), new items will be added on the end
of the list. ``pop`` operations will manipulate that same end.
