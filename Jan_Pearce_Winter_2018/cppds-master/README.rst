Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using C++
=============================================================

This book began as the paper book, *Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python*, first published by Franklin Beedle & Associates written by Brad Miller and David Ranum back in 2005.  It was translated to C++ by Jan Pearce and a team of excellent Berea
College students in the summer of 2018. We are all grateful for the vision of Jim Leisy who gave permission to take the original Python version of this text and freely publish it online as an interactive textbook.

Getting Started
===============

We have tried to make it as easy as possible for you to build and use this book.  

1. You can see and read this book online at `interactivepython.org <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/cppds/index.html>`_

2.  You can build it and host it yourself in just a few simple steps:

    1.  ``pip install git+git://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneComponents.git``  -- Should install everything you need
    2.  ``runestone build`` -- will build the html and put it in ``./build/cppds``
    3.  ``runestone serve``   -- will start a webserver and serve the pages locally from ``./build/cppds``
